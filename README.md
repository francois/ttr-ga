TTR GA
======
There's a wonderful game by Days of Wonder called [Ticket To Ride][1]. This game is a magnificient board game: the graphics are beautiful, you get to play with friends, and can play in double-crossing mode or not.

Days of Wonder created an iOS version of the game, which is loads of fun. It removes all drudgery of placing the wagons, shuffling the cards, anything that a computer can do better than us.

This repository is my attempt at building a genetic algorithm to find the best possible route to maximize the number of points. The GA should support known options and variants: 1910 Mega, 1910 classic, 1910 Big Cities, longest route bonus and globetrotter bonus.

The code is in Haskell, because I want to learn more about it. I also want to implement a GA myself, not reuse an existing library. This is a learning experience.

Eventually, I want the code to evolve (*pun intended*) to have an AI that can beat the built-in AIs in the iOS game.
